# My-Bachelor-Thesis July 2010

Title of my bachelor thesis is: "security analysis of possible attacks to the electronic city".
In my thesis at first, I talked about parts of an electronic city. For example, electronic hospital, electronic learning, electronic banking and payments and I explained advantages and disadvantages of each one. In this chapter, we can get familiar with basic parts of e-city and what kind of services should provide by every part. For instance, in Electronic Banking I explained E-commerce definition, E-banking definition, E-banking services and etc.
In the next chapter of the thesis, I talked about hacking methods. Hacking methods which target our website. For example SQL injection and XSS. Also, in continue, I explained prevention ways of these kinds of attacks. Next part belongs to the attacks target the programs under the OS like viruses and Trojans. In these two parts, we can read what are viruses and Trojans and they bring what kinds of treats to OS. In the part of thesis about worms, I talked in details about them because in that period I was very interested about the functionality of computer worms and I have my own special researches about a vulnerability in Microsoft Win XP SP2. In this part, I talked about the analysis of a worm and vulnerability in operating systems and programming languages. In action, I mentioned two examples of them.
In the section of attacks that target our networks, I listed all active services and ports and possible attacks to them. So I prepared a list of all kinds of attacks and I inserted a short comment about each one of them. For example, there are DOS, DDOS, TCP/IP Hijacking, Brute force, Ping of Death, Buffer Overflow Exploits, Zero-Day Exploits and etc. explained as attacks to networks or services under the networks.
In the last section, I talked about physical security. I mean I talked about building, locations, architectural features' and crisis that could effect of data center's security.
I have translated my contents of bachelor thesis to English and I insert it below. SO you can check the Contents.
